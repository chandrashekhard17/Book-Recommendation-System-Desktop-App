## Description

The Book Recommendation System is designed to help users discover books based on their reading history and preferences. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and content-based filtering, the application suggests books similar to those the user has rated highly. The system also provides detailed information about each book, including author, genre, and a brief description, fetched from external APIs.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides book suggestions tailored to individual preferences.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **Detailed Book Information**: Displays comprehensive details about each recommended book.
- **User Ratings**: Users can rate books, improving the accuracy of future recommendations.

## Datasets

The recommendation system is trained using the following datasets:

- **[GoodBooks-10K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k)**: Contains 10,000 books and over 6 million ratings from Goodreads.
- **[Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)**: A dataset containing information about books, including titles, authors, and genres.
- **[Main Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation)**: This dataset contents comprehensive dataset related to that Project
